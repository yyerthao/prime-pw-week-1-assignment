# 1 - What is the command for listing the files in the current folder (directory)?
ls

# 2 - What is the command for changing directories?
cd

# 3 - What is the command for going "up" a folder (to a parent directory)?
cd ..

# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?
mkdir samplefoldername

# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty
folder? What about a folder containing files?
Nothing would load when you run command 'ls' in an empty folder.
For a folder containing files, running command 'ls' would result in a list
with the file names of that folder displayed underneath.

# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?
touch filename.txt
(Per my Googling research, it looks like there could be a different type of
file to be added in Git, but it seems to have more complicated "rules" so per
that, I answered with a text file. I hope that train of thought is valid?)

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
The output reads: git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128). Basically it tells you
the version of git your computer has, IF you have git.

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
Running the command 'git status' informs us about the status of our current
folder and whether or not there were changes made. This is crucial especially
if we want to pursue pushing our commits to a source like Github.
(I hope I understood this correctly!)

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
From my understanding, the command 'git add .' adds all the files in the current
folder, into Git. (It also stages or gets our files ready to be committed.)

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
git commit -m "Write message about actions just performed here". <-- I think
that is what the answer is to this question.
